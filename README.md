# Trauma-Dementia-Analysis

### Purpose

**Trauma and stroke are leading causes of brain injury, and we observe these in patients with motor vehicle accidents and sports-related injuries. These injuries can have various impacts on the motor functions, such as loss of speech, movement, or consciousness. **

##### I would like to explore some questions: 
- Are certain patients more predisposed to dementia or dementia-like diagnosis? 
- Is there is a genetic predisposition that leads to more severe dementia-like symptoms? 
- Do specific types of proteins accumulate in patients with trauma? 
- Are there increased levels of particular proteins that lead to worse outcomes in terms of mental functioning?

### Data Source
- Aging, Dementia and Traumatic Brain Injury Study, consisting of 110 patients from the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) Study.
