# Trauma-Dementia-Analysis

### Purpose

**Trauma and stroke are leading causes of brain injury, and we observe these in patients with motor vehicle accidents and sports-related injuries. These injuries can have various impacts on the motor functions, such as loss of speech, movement, or consciousness.**

##### I would like to explore some questions: 
- Are certain patients more predisposed to dementia or dementia-like diagnosis? 
- Is there is a genetic predisposition that leads to more severe dementia-like symptoms? 
- Do specific types of proteins accumulate in patients with trauma? 
- Are there increased levels of particular proteins that lead to worse outcomes in terms of mental functioning?

### Data Source
- Aging, Dementia and Traumatic Brain Injury Study, consisting of 110 patients from the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) Study. 
- http://aging.brain-map.org/overview/home
- Deidentified clinical information from 110 patients
  - Age, Gender, Clinical information, Dementia status, Patient Diagnosis to name a few
- Protein levels measured in 4 portions of the brain from the 110 patients based on samples collected from each patientâ€™s brain.
  - Quantities of 29 proteins measured in the Temporal lobe, Parietal lobe, Frontal lobe & Hippocampus parts of the human subjects. 
- RNA-seq gene expression measurements from 377 samples (107 patients)
  - This includes 50,281 different genes. As the quantity of the genes is very high, I will need to filter the number of genes based on a certain criterion.
